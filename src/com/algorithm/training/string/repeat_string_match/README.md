## 686. Repeated String Match

**Difficulty:** Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-string-match/description/

Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. <br/>
If no such solution, return -1. <br/>

For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab". <br/>

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd"). <br/>

```
Input: abcd
Output: cdabcdab
```

**Note:** The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.
